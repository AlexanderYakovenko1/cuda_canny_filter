Canny filter implementation in C++/CUDA.

The code is largely based on the ideas from
Lourenco L. H. A., Weingaertner D., Todt E. Efficient implementation of canny edge detection filter for ITK using CUDA // 2012 13th Symposium on Computer Systems. – IEEE, 2012. – pp. 33-40.

Convolutions are based on the following
Podlozhnyuk V. "Image convolution with CUDA" // NVIDIA Corporation white paper, June. – 2007.
